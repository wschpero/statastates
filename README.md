# statastates

statastates is a simple Stata module for adding U.S. state identifiers (abbreviation, FIPS code, ICPSR code, and name) that may be missing from your dataset.

### Prerequisites

**Stata**: statastates should be compatible with Stata v12.1+. While it may be compatible with earlier versions, it has not been tested in those environments.

### Installation Options

**SSC Archive**: Run the code below via the Stata command line. (Will still give the old version)

	ssc install statastates, replace

**Github (for Stata v13.1+)**: Run the code below via the Stata command line.

	net install statastates, from(https://raw.github.com/dmockus2/statastates/master/) replace

**Github (for Stata v12.1+)**: [Download](https://github.com/dmockus2/statastates/archive/master.zip) the files above. Run the code below via the Stata command line, inserting the directory where you saved the files.

	net install statastates, from(<LOCAL PATH TO FILES>) replace

### Using statastates

statastates is pretty easy to use. Just run the command and include the relevant option, which is contingent on whether you would like to merge using the two-letter state abbreviation, FIPS code, or name.

For example, if you have the state abbreviations in your dataset under the variable "state" and want to merge state FIPS codes and names using that variable, enter the following:

	statastates, abbreviation(state)

If you have the state FIPS codes in your dataset under the variable "state" and want to merge state abbreviations and names using that variable, enter the following:

	statastates, fips(state)

If you have the state names in your dataset under the variable "state" and want to merge state abbreviations and FIPS codes using that variable, enter the following:

	statastates, name(state)

Lastly, if you have the state ICPSR codes in your dataset under the variable "state" and want to merge state abbreviations and names using that variable, enter the following:

    statastates, icpsr(state)

By default, statastates will generate a new variable, `_merge`, to mark merge results. If you do not want to create this variable (and simply keep matched observations and unmatched master observations), specify the option `nogenerate`.

	statastates, name(state) nogenerate
